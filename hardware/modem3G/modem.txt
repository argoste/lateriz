G modem HSDPA	
Price	15.00 EUR

MOD-USB3G would also work with your laptop and desktop computer - the drivers are located inside the unit.

Note that due to impulse current surges (up to 2A) you might be unable to use MOD-USB3G with other Olimex boards out-of-the-box. You would either need to make hardware adjustements or purchase additional adapter called USB-CAP. For more information refer to the notice in the FAQ section at the bottom of the page.

	USB-CAP low ESR filter for current hungry devices	
Price	3.00 EUR
10 - 49 pcs	2.70 EUR
50 - 10000 pcs	2.40 EUR
MOD-USB3G and other similar devices have high current consumption peaks during initialization (up to 2A) and some USB hosts have hard time providing such surge currents. We designed USB-CAP (contains 2 x 1000uF capacitors) with low ESR to remove these power supply glitches.
USB-CAP provides USB supply filtering to enable the operation of current-hungry devices with weak USB hosts.
