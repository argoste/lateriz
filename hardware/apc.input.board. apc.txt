apc input board. apc is hold with 2 hands like a small console ie psp. the two pollici have distint functions, with right moving joistick mouse, enter, ctrl, shift altgr. left ismostly for ascii.
when will it be used? keeping it in hand on on a flat surface like a table?
how can we protect the screen?
resist touchscreen is an option but the stylus is not that good
