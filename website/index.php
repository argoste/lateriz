      <h2>The house analogy</h2>
      <div>Two Titans, the Free Software gnu and the Open Hardware wheel, hold the construction.</div>
      <div>This is unpolished, made of many brics.</div>
      <div>The yellow brick, Lateriz, is only a part of a
        linked, multidisciplinary, complex system.</div>
      <div>The workman and the nerd can enjoy their activities.
