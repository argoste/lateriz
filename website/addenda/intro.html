    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This is a <dfn title="Immagine it like a tree that has a trunc
    dividing in several branch, every branch has one parent and can have many
    children">hierarchical list</dfn>, but should be a
    <dfn title="Imagine it like a network of nodes,  with each one connected to
    other nodes">pseudograph</dfn>
    instead.
    In fact the real mind map</a> is inherently
    network-like, with parts referring to other parts. 
    Also one branch can be a different way to look at the same object. </p>
