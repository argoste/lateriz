    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p><b>Lateriz project</b> is about small, portable devices.</p>
    <p>I'm unsatisfacted about smartphones as they are nowadays. Maybe I can
    put together some pre-made hardware and software to make one that suits me.</p>
    <p>The project was once called Adventure Personal Computer (APC), meaning a device
    suited for an active life style, for woods, for construction sites etc.</p>
